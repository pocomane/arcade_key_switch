# Arcade Key Switch MOD

This repository contains the 3D models to mount common keyboard mechanical switches
on commercial Arcade Sticks. It was designed for the Seimitsu LS-56 stick, however
the models are parametrick so we hope you can easly adapt to other sticks.

![Overview of the model](doc/model.jpg)

# Feature

- Seimitsu LS-56 support out-of-the-box.

- Easy tweakable (we hope)

- Short trhow and engage (similar to 5mm Kowal plate modification for the LS-56)

- Four type of gate: rond-based, square, octagonal and diamond. The latter is
  a mix of the the square and octagonal one, configuragble with a single simple
  parameter.

# Compiling the models

In this repository you will find the OpenSCAD[^1] sources of
the models. We will soon provide the final `stl` model to quickly print them,
however for any changes over the default configuration, you need to modify the
source and recompile it. It is very simple, please refer to the OpenSCAD[^1]
documentation.

For a quick overview of the source, mounting instruction, etc, please refere to
the [documentation](doc/doc.md) in this repository.
